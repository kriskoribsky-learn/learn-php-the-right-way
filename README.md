# Learn-php-the-right-way
Repository used for following the: "Learn PHP The Right Way" tutorial on YouTube

## The source code for the PHP series "Learn PHP The Right Way".

This repository will contain the code related to specific lessons/videos separated by branches. I will create my own working solutions to tasks encountered along the course and compare them with orginal [author's](https://github.com/ggelashvili) solutions. <br>
Therefore, the branch structure will be identical with the original repository.

## Branches
* **1.x** - Code for the first section of the course where **x** indicates the video number where it was implemented
* **2.x** - Code for the second section of the course where **x** indicates the video number where it was implemented
* **3.x** - Code for the third section of the course where **x** indicates the video number where it was implemented
